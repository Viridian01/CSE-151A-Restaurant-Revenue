## Preprocessing

- As we started to explore our data, we found that our data was already quite clean, and the only two required steps were **scaling the data** and **encoding the categorical features**.
- **Scaling the data**
  - We used min-max normalization, as the data is not very normally distributed.
- **Encoding the categorical features**
  - We used one-hot encoding for Cuisine and Location to encode the categorical features. For Parking Availability, it made more sense to encode it simply as 0 and 1 because the feature is a boolean value.
 
## Model Selection

- After preprocessing, we tried a variety of different models without any tuning to see how they perform on the dataset. Specifically, we use linear regression, a decision tree, a random forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and an SVM. Out of these (without tuning), the random forest performed the best, so we attempted to tune its hyperparameters a bit.
