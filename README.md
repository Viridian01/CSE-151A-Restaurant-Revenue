## Preprocessing

- As we started to explore our data, we found that our data was already quite clean, and the only two required steps were **scaling the data**, **encoding the categorical features**, and **removing outliers**.
- **Scaling the data**
  - We used min-max normalization, as the data is not very normally distributed.
- **Encoding the categorical features**
  - We used one-hot encoding for Cuisine and Location to encode the categorical features. For Parking Availability, it made more sense to encode it simply as 0 and 1 because the feature is a boolean value.
-  **Removing Outliers**
   - To remove the outliers, we used log transformation.
 
## Regression Models

- With our data cleaned up, we created our first models, starting with a linear and polynomial model.
