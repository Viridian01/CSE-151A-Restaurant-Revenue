## Preprocessing

- As we started to explore our data, we found that our data was already quite clean, and the only two required steps were **scaling the data** and **encoding the categorical features**.
- **Scaling the data**
  - We will use min-max normalization, as the data is not very normally distributed.
- **Encoding the categorical features**
  - We will use one-hot encoding for Cuisine and Location to encode the categorical features. For Parking Availability, it makes more sense to encode it simply as 0 and 1 due to the feature being a boolean value.

Here's the [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Viridian01/CSE-151A-Restaurant-Revenue/blob/main/main.ipynb) to our data exploration.
